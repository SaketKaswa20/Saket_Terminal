# Saket_Terminal


This is a simple web-based terminal built using HTML, CSS (with Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript. The terminal provides a command-line interface where you can enter commands and get corresponding outputs.

## Getting Started

To use the Web Terminal, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The terminal will be displayed on the page, and you can start entering commands.

## Features

- Customized terminal UI with a neon green text color and a deep black background.
- Macbook-like buttons (close, minimize, maximize) at the top left corner of the terminal for aesthetic purposes.
- Vertical scrollbar inside the terminal with a neon green color to match the text.
- Commands available:
  - `whoami`: Displays my name.
  - `clear`: Clears the terminal screen.
  - `exit`: Exits the terminal with a message.
  - `github`: Opens my GitHub profile (https://github.com/SaketKaswa20).
  - `linkedin`: Opens my LinkedIn profile (https://www.linkedin.com/in/saket-kaswa/).
  - `cd`: Shows my current location.
  - `saket --version`: Displays my current age.
  - `saket --education`: Displays my current education status.
  - `mail`: Should open the mail app and start writing a mail to kaswasd21.coep@gmail.com.
  - `help`: Shows available commands and their descriptions.

## How to Use

1. Enter a command in the input field (e.g., `whoami`, `github`, etc.).
2. Press the `Enter` key to execute the command.
3. The output of the command will be displayed on the next line.

## Note

- The Macbook-like buttons are for aesthetics only and do not have any functionality.
- The terminal is styled to be responsive and should adjust to different screen sizes.

## Acknowledgments
